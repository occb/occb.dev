## Overview

* Stayed about 23 day in total in Japan during _Momiji_ (indian summer) season. Cherry blossom season only lasts for about two weeks and is very expensive and crowded, Momiji can be experienced about 6 - 8 weeks and is tracked on several websites to catch the autumn colors.
* Route (hubs only): [Tokyo](#tokyo) - Nagoya - [Takayama](#takayama) - [Kanazawa](#kanazawa) - [Kyoto](#kyoto) - [Hiroshima](#hiroshima) - [Miyajima](#miyajima) - [Osaka](#osaka)
* Traveled only by public transportation, which was a great experience. The _Japan Rail Pass_ is reall worth it's money and allows usage of nearly all Shinkansen high-speed trains, combined with a lot of more local networks. For me, this was the best and most efficient way to travel between the cities.
* For local transportation, the _Suica Card_ is great and can be used to easily pay for metros, trains, subways and busses.
* No need to carry a heavy travel guide, all you need is the local tourist info, usually located at your arrival train station. Very friendly and helpful tourist guides provide you with a local map and all the tips you need.
* _K-Hostel_ has several well located hostels to use, but also try local traditional accommodations or even a capsule hotel.
* Diversity and quality of food was overwhelming, even 24/7 stores have some meals which are good. A lot of smaller restaurants have open kitchens and you can see the food preparation.
* Tokyo Metro provides an easily understandable subway map, each station I visited was very clean, most of them did have a lot of helpful staff.
* If needed, you can rent mobile routers to use high-speed WiFi with a local SIM card, they can be picked up at the airport and mailed back via drop-off at a postbox.
* Stopover in [Dubai](../2018-11-23-dubai)
