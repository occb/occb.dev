## Overview

* Stayed only two night, during the flight back from [Japan](../2018-11-23-japan).
* One highlight was the visit to the Jumeirah Grand Mosque, including an exceptional tour.
* The other highlight was a "Bedouin Culture Safari" with Platinum Heritage. Very well organized, small group, great guide and very interesting insights including e. g. an eagle show and a breakfast in camp.
* Due to some very inconsiderate fellow travelers, the city tour by bus was sadly a rather bad experience with a lot of unnecessary stress and discomfort.
* Usually I just start walking around a city and get lost, you should be prepared to deal with some heat and an interesting bus schedule, if you leave the central business district.
* If interested, of course dubai does provide great shopping malls and architectural landmarks.
