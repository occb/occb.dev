Very well organized, small group, great guide and very interesting insights including e. g. an eagle show and a breakfast in camp Due to some very inconsiderate fellow travelers, the city tour by bus was sadly a rather bad experience with a lot of unnecessary stress and discomfort Usually I just start walking around a city and get lost, you should be prepared to deal with some heat and an interesting bus schedule, if you leave the central business district If interested, of course dubai does provide great shopping malls and architectural landmarks View of Dubai City Jumeirah Grand Mosque Inside Jumeirah Grand Mosque View of Dubai City View of Burj Khalifa Nightly view from observation platform of the Burj Khalifa Nightly view from observation deck of the Burj Khalifa Nightly view of the Burj Khalifa &amp;#34;The Dubai Fountain&amp;#34; in front of the Burj Khalifa Sunrise view of Dubai City Jeeps used for the desert trip Trying to ride a camel Still trying to ride a camel Camel tour shadows On tour near camel territory Hugging some desert Burj al Arab during sunset</description></item><item><title>2018: Japan</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2018-11-23-japan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2018-11-23-japan/</guid><description>Overview Stayed about 23 day in total in Japan during Momiji (indian summer) season. Cherry blossom season only lasts for about two weeks and is very expensive and crowded, Momiji can be experienced about 6 - 8 weeks and is tracked on several websites to catch the autumn colors. Route (hubs only): Tokyo - Nagoya - Takayama - Kanazawa - Kyoto - Hiroshima - Miyajima - Osaka Traveled only by public transportation, which was a great experience.</description></item><item><title>2018: Ireland</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2018-06-20-ireland/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2018 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2018-06-20-ireland/</guid><description>Overview Short trip (7 days) with colleagues during summer. Road trip with rented car (prepare for left-hand traffic): Dublin - Doolin - Limerick - Killarney - Cork - Kilkenny - Dublin, with a booked daytrip by bus to Northern Ireland Route was very well chosen, with some nice spots to rest at the sea, and a good amount of historic sites. Can recommend to rent a cottage with fireplace if possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
