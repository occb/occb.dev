One highlight was the visit to the Jumeirah Grand Mosque, including an exceptional tour. The other highlight was a &amp;ldquo;Bedouin Culture Safari&amp;rdquo; with Platinum Heritage. Very well organized, small group, great guide and very interesting insights including e. g. an eagle show and a breakfast in camp. Due to some very inconsiderate fellow travelers, the city tour by bus was sadly a rather bad experience with a lot of unnecessary stress and discomfort.</description></item></channel></rss>
