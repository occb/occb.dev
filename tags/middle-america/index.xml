At the time, most casas particulares could only be booked by telephone. Best way was to ask the current host, usually they could help out and contact someone at your next planned destination. Bus roundtrip with hubs Havana, Viñales, Trinidad and María la Gorda. Felt very safe everywhere, a lot more than in Mexico.</description></item><item><title>2016: Guatemala, Belize, Mexico</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2016-05-20-guatemala-belize-mexico/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2016 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2016-05-20-guatemala-belize-mexico/</guid><description>Overview Well planned trip to three countries (Guatemala, Belize, Mexico), at least accommondations were mostly booked beforehand. Traveled with a colleague, who did know Spanish. English would not have been enough. Tested my limits in regards of poverty, pollution and military presence, but for sure expanded my ideas of friendship, human kindness, humility and hospitality. I took diving classes beforehand and gained a PADI AOWD certification to explore some great spots here and in Cuba.</description></item></channel></rss>
