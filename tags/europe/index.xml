Stayed a few days in Stockholm before taking a (recommended) night train up to Abisko. I had three nights to catch some Nothern Lights: one was very cloudy, one was partially cloudy, one was clear and it was for me one of the most majestic shows I have ever seen. I usually travel with one stuffed backpack. On these nights, I had to put on every piece of cloth I brought to Sweden.</description></item></channel></rss>
