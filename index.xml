One highlight was the visit to the Jumeirah Grand Mosque, including an exceptional tour. The other highlight was a &amp;ldquo;Bedouin Culture Safari&amp;rdquo; with Platinum Heritage. Very well organized, small group, great guide and very interesting insights including e. g. an eagle show and a breakfast in camp. Due to some very inconsiderate fellow travelers, the city tour by bus was sadly a rather bad experience with a lot of unnecessary stress and discomfort.</description></item><item><title>2018: Japan</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2018-11-23-japan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2018-11-23-japan/</guid><description>Overview Stayed about 23 day in total in Japan during Momiji (indian summer) season. Cherry blossom season only lasts for about two weeks and is very expensive and crowded, Momiji can be experienced about 6 - 8 weeks and is tracked on several websites to catch the autumn colors. Route (hubs only): Tokyo - Nagoya - Takayama - Kanazawa - Kyoto - Hiroshima - Miyajima - Osaka Traveled only by public transportation, which was a great experience.</description></item><item><title>2018: Ireland</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2018-06-20-ireland/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2018 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2018-06-20-ireland/</guid><description>Overview Short trip (7 days) with colleagues during summer. Road trip with rented car (prepare for left-hand traffic): Dublin - Doolin - Limerick - Killarney - Cork - Kilkenny - Dublin, with a booked daytrip by bus to Northern Ireland Route was very well chosen, with some nice spots to rest at the sea, and a good amount of historic sites. Can recommend to rent a cottage with fireplace if possible.</description></item><item><title>2017: Sweden</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2017-11-20-sweden/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2017 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2017-11-20-sweden/</guid><description>Overview Short trip to mainly see the Nothern Lights in Abisko. Stayed a few days in Stockholm before taking a (recommended) night train up to Abisko. I had three nights to catch some Nothern Lights: one was very cloudy, one was partially cloudy, one was clear and it was for me one of the most majestic shows I have ever seen. I usually travel with one stuffed backpack. On these nights, I had to put on every piece of cloth I brought to Sweden.</description></item><item><title>2016: Iceland</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2016-08-03-iceland/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2016 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2016-08-03-iceland/</guid><description>Overview Road trip between jobs, mainly in the south and south-eastern parts, including the Golden Cirle route. Stunning landscapes, stunning views, stunning prices. Very friendly accommodations, usually a breakfast of Skyr and some fruit was provided. Reykjavík has enough free geothermal energy to build a heating system for it&amp;rsquo;s streets and sidewalks. You should prepare for quite a good amount of strong winds. Sadly, I missed the opportunity to dive between the continental plates.</description></item><item><title>2016: Cuba</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2016-05-20-cuba/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2016 20:13:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2016-05-20-cuba/</guid><description>Overview Next stop in middle america before going home after already visiting Guatemala, Belize and Mexico. At the time, most casas particulares could only be booked by telephone. Best way was to ask the current host, usually they could help out and contact someone at your next planned destination. Bus roundtrip with hubs Havana, Viñales, Trinidad and María la Gorda. Felt very safe everywhere, a lot more than in Mexico.</description></item><item><title>2016: Guatemala, Belize, Mexico</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2016-05-20-guatemala-belize-mexico/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2016 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2016-05-20-guatemala-belize-mexico/</guid><description>Overview Well planned trip to three countries (Guatemala, Belize, Mexico), at least accommondations were mostly booked beforehand. Traveled with a colleague, who did know Spanish. English would not have been enough. Tested my limits in regards of poverty, pollution and military presence, but for sure expanded my ideas of friendship, human kindness, humility and hospitality. I took diving classes beforehand and gained a PADI AOWD certification to explore some great spots here and in Cuba.</description></item><item><title>2014: New Zealand</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2014-12-25-new-zealand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2014 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2014-12-25-new-zealand/</guid><description>TBD Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test</description></item><item><title>2013: Australia</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2013-11-03-australia/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2013 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2013-11-03-australia/</guid><description>TBD Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test Test</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://occb.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/about/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Oliver!
