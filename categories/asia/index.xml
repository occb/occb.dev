Cherry blossom season only lasts for about two weeks and is very expensive and crowded, Momiji can be experienced about 6 - 8 weeks and is tracked on several websites to catch the autumn colors. Route (hubs only): Tokyo - Nagoya - Takayama - Kanazawa - Kyoto - Hiroshima - Miyajima - Osaka Traveled only by public transportation, which was a great experience.</description></item></channel></rss>
