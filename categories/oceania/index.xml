After that, roadtrip in the southern part of the southern island was planned, with hubs: Christchurch, Punakaiki, Wanaka, Queenstown, Milford Sound, Doubtful Sounds, passing Queenstown to Mount Cook, back to Christchurch. Had some great day hiking trips, but also missed a lot of great opportunities to be explored later. New Zealand is just great overall.</description></item><item><title>2013: Australia</title><link>https://occb.dev/post/2013-11-03-australia/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2013 20:12:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://occb.dev/post/2013-11-03-australia/</guid><description>Overview First long trip overseas, always tried to evolve my travel habits since then. Visited one of my best friends, who is currently living in Melbourne. Route with main hubs: arriving in Melbourne, roadtrip in Tasmania, Melbourne and exploring the Great Ocean Road, Sydney. Tasmania has been a real treat, I recommend about two weeks to explore the island. Melbourse is a fantastic city. Not too big, not too small, very livable.</description></item></channel></rss>
